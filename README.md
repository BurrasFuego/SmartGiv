Emergency donation system using blockchain technology. U-Hack 2024

## The problem it solves

Today, philanthropic activities and charitable giving are key to addressing a variety of social, humanitarian and environmental issues. However, the traditional donation process often faces obstacles such as lack of transparency, high transaction costs and delays in distributing funds to charities. The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology provide a potential solution to the current challenges of donation systems, but also bring new questions and obstacles.

Lack of transparency in the management of funds and methods for allocating resources to social causes or emergencies can mean that potential donors may be discouraged from contributing to help get involved in solving social problems. The absence of a clear process can generate doubts and affect the reputation of charitable organizations.

In addition, one of the current limitations with the use of blockchain technology is that users do not have the necessary familiarity with its use and its technical complexity in the management of cryptocurrency addresses and the security of transactions can be an obstacle for a complete adoption and even acceptance. Transaction security and protection against potential fraud are ongoing and critical concerns that must be addressed to ensure the integrity of the donation process. Also, the lack of a legal framework for cryptocurrency transactions and donations can create uncertainty and hinder the legal and ethical operation of the platform.
